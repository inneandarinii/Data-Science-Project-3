# Data-Science-Project-3

I recently completed a project about weather prediction project using machine learning algorithms. This project aimed to forecast maximum temperatures based on historical weather data from Oakland International Airport, CA, USA.

🔍 Key Highlights:
* Machine Learning Model: Utilizing Ridge Regression for weather prediction, considering factors such as PRCP, TMAX, and TMIN.
* Feature Engineering: Enhancing predictions by incorporating additional features like monthly averages and day-of-year averages.
* Performance Evaluation: Measuring model accuracy using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and analyzing correlation coefficients between different weather variables.

🎯 Project Objectives: The difference between the actual temperature and the temperature predicted results, predicted temperature estimates are generated by ML model, and identify  the variables influencing the target maximum temperature.
