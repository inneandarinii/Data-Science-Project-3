# Data-Science-Project-3

I recently completed a project about weather prediction project using machine learning algorithms. This project aimed to forecast maximum temperatures based on historical weather data from Oakland International Airport, CA, USA. The data spanned from January 1, 1960, to February 5, 2022.

🔍 Key Highlights:
* Machine Learning Model: Utilizing Ridge Regression for weather prediction, considering factors such as PRCP, TMAX, and TMIN.
* Feature Engineering: Enhancing predictions by incorporating additional features like monthly averages and day-of-year averages.
* Performance Evaluation: Measuring model accuracy using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and analyzing correlation coefficients between different weather variables.

🎯 Project Objectives: The difference between the actual temperature and the temperature predicted results, predicted temperature estimates are generated by ML model, and identify  the variables influencing the target maximum temperature.
